# DUIT-IoT-DATASET
The DUIT dataset contains network traffic data from a controlled SDN-based testbed, simulating and mitigating dynamic DDoS attacks (DNS, UDP, ICMP, TCP SYN flood) in IoT networks. It includes traffic patterns, attack scenarios, and mitigation actions, with labeled instances for developing machine learning models for IoT security.
